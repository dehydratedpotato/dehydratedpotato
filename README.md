<!--<p align="center">I am a software developer whos making random stuff whenever I feel like it, mostly for Apple platforms.  I'm really into design, and low level stuff like CPU architecture and the like. Every now and then I annoy myself trying to decompile closed source apps and tools so you may see some stuff like that around here.</p>-->
<p align="center">hi. every now and then i pull some software out of myself, usually for the mac. nothing special most of the time, just the best stuff. i am a proud hater of java with no relations to java. i enjoy hating enthusiastically fixing bad code. i enjoy low-level things, and sometimes decompile junk while my soul dies. and, i have a buy me a coffee, but i don't really do anything around here to deserve donos, so do what you will with my button. <br><br> <a align="" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dehydratedtato" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" style="height: 35px !important;" ></a></p>
