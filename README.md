I am a young tech enthusiast and self-taught developer with a designer eye and an art gene, developing random software for Apple Platforms, often getting involved in really janky reverse engineering projects (yet I'm obsessed with efficiency). I'm deeply intrigued by CPUs, digital logic design, and misc architectural stuff.

I'm working on a few productivty apps / developer tools for the App Store, but we'll see how long until I finish any. Here on Github, you'll see a wide (but also slightly related) array of projects I conjure in various amounts of time.

My chosen programming lanuguages are:

- Swift (of course)
- SwiftUI (it sucks but makes things so much easier and is slowly getting better)
- Objective-C (I'd use plain C more often but then I'd have NeXTSTEP withdrawals)
- Shell (but only when I deem it practical)

I occasionally touch on the web based side of things, but let's just say that I don't particularly enjoy using JavaScript.
