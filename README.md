## ðŸ¤” About me...

- I'm a young tech enthusiast and self-taught dev with a design eye, making random stuff and junk for Apple Platforms.
- I'm obsessed with polished experiences and efficiency, but also enjoy working on janky reverse engineering projects (for some reason).
- I'm also very interested in the various aspects of CPUs, digital logic design, and miscellaneous architectural stuff. 
- Currently focusing on Swift, and working on a few App Store projects (we'll see how long until I finish any)...
