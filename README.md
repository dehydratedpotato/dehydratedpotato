:wave: _Greetings!_ Or, perhaps I should say:

### Greetings.
I’m sort of an Apple Developer, I guess. I focus on the Mac side and sometimes try to do some iOS-y stuff.

I’m really into low level things, especially anything directly involving CPU architecture, and I enjoy decompiling closed source stuff sometimes. Not at all afraid of C or Assembley like any of these new Swift developers, but I do hate Java. I try to write code that is as fast and optimized as It can possibly be, at least for projects that "deserve" it. I'm also a bit of an artist so I feel certain kinds of ways when it comes to design. 

If you want to support me in case I managed to make something that's actually coolish, you can...

...if you care to, otherwise put that darn money in savings.
