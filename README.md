## ðŸ¤” About me...

- I'm a young tech enthusiast and self-taught dev with a design eye, making random tools and junk for Apple Platforms.
- I'm obsessed with polished experiences and efficiency, although I often get involved in janky reverse engineering projects (for some reason).
- I'm also very interested in the various aspects of CPUs, digital logic design, and miscellaneous architectural stuff. 
- Currently working on a handful of projects for the App Store, but we'll see how long until I finish any...
