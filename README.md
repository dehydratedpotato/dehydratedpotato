<h3 align="center">:potato: brief greetings!</h3>
<!--<p align="center">I am a software developer whos making random stuff whenever I feel like it, mostly for Apple platforms.  I'm really into design, and low level stuff like CPU architecture and the like. Every now and then I annoy myself trying to decompile closed source apps and tools so you may see some stuff like that around here.</p>-->
