## 🔍 About Me...

- I'm a young tech enthusiast and self-taught developer with a designer eye developing random software for Apple Platforms.
- I'm obsessed with polished experiences and efficiency, but often get involved in janky reverse engineering projects on the side.
- I'm also interested in various aspects of CPUs, digital logic design, and misc architectural stuff. 
- Currently working on a handful of projects for the App Store, but we'll see how long until I finish any. 😅
