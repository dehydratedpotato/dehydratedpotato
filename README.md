### ðŸ–– uuum hi there
I'm an Apple Developer who spends various amounts of time working on (occasionally jank) stuff revolving around lower level architect-y things (while simultaneously trying to make some actual apps). I try to write code that is as efficient and optimized as it can possibly be, at least for projects that "deserve" it. I hate Java and defying Apple makes me feel good.
