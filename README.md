I am a young tech enthusiast who holds interests **CPU architecting, electrical engineering, interface design, 
computer graphics, software development**, and a handful of other loosely related topics. 

I enjoy creating unique open source projects here on Github, just recently testing out the Apple Developer/App Store experience with my first watchOS app, [Coin Fliporator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coin-fliporator/id1611054060). My preferred programming languages are C-based (although I dislike C#). I make use of Shell when it seems more practical. I'm slowly learning to like Swift.

If you would like to support me and all of my projects, a small donation to my [Cash App](https://cash.app/$bitespotatobacks) would be much appreciated!
