Just a young tech enthusiast developing software for Apple Platforms. I hold interests in anything centered around design, hardware engineering, and low-level architectural stuff. I'm intrigued by janky reverse engineering and system-breaking kinds of things, but have a deep obsession with efficiency and intuitiveness.

My coding expertise lay with Swift/SwiftUI and Objective-C (which I honestly only use over standard C for the NeXTSTEP data types). I occasionally touch on Bash and Shell, as well as the web-based side of things.
